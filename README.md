**A modern Windows (WinUI 3) application to consolidate source code from a project directory into a single, LLM-optimized file.**

## Description

CodeSnapshotter is a utility designed for software developers who leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for code analysis, debugging, or documentation. It scans a project directory, intelligently filters files and folders based on user-defined rules, and aggregates the relevant source code into a single, well-structured Markdown or text file.
This solves the problem of manually copying and pasting dozens of files into an LLM, preserving the file structure context and making the AI's analysis more accurate and insightful.

## Features

-   **Intuitive UI**: A clean, modern interface built with WinUI 3.
-   **Folder Selection**: Easily pick any project directory on your system.
-   **Powerful Filtering**:
    -   Include files by extension (e.g., `.cs`, `.xaml`, `.ts`).
    -   Exclude common directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj`).
    -   Exclude specific files (e.g., `package-lock.json`).
-   **Optimized Output**:
    -   **Markdown Mode**: Formats each file with a clear header and a language-specific code block for syntax highlighting.
    -   **Plain Text Mode**: Separates files with a simple, clean header.
-   **Responsive & Asynchronous**: The UI remains fully responsive while processing files in the background.
